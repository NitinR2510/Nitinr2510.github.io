## learning html and css
This website is probably a month long course of HTML and CSS. I created a very fancy and beautiful website but obviously, what it lacked was accessibility and so, in the new one, I have tried to resolve as many accessibility issues as I could.
## github as a platform
GitHub provides excellent hosting services. I have hosted this page on the link I have mentioned above.
