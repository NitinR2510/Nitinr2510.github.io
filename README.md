## learning html and css

I created the page https://nitinr2510.github.io/home/  as my first ever HTML+CSS project which was the original website - the only page on the link. Now, it is a multi-page website with two pages (the projects page and the poem page) built on custom themes.

## github as a platform

GitHub provides excellent hosting services.
